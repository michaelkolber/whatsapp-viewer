10/31/16, 7:02:38 AM: Chana: That's a good 💡
10/31/16, 9:14:03 AM: Michael Kolber: Update: I didn't go
10/31/16, 9:16:05 AM: Chana: Update: why not
10/31/16, 9:16:27 AM: Michael Kolber: I went out to lunch with my friend in another part of the city
10/31/16, 9:16:37 AM: Michael Kolber: You're gonna love Israel btw
10/31/16, 9:21:48 AM: Chana: I don't doubt it
10/31/16, 9:22:48 AM: Michael Kolber: You should get a higher paying job next summer, maybe even this summer, even if it's not so fun. You'll be happy to have the money
10/31/16, 9:23:59 AM: Michael Kolber: Also, apparently Moshe Stewart and one of his friends were playing on Ben Yehudah and they made like 100 dollars in a day
10/31/16, 12:12:20 PM: Chana: That's cool. But yeah I probably should get an anything paying job. After this summer I'm gonna be broke
10/31/16, 1:18:58 PM: Chana: Where did you get all that money from!! And on what? All food and transportation?
10/31/16, 1:21:03 PM: Michael Kolber: I saved and worked!
10/31/16, 1:21:18 PM: Michael Kolber: Yeah, food and transport, guest gifts,
10/31/16, 2:02:54 PM: Chana: Did you buy anything for yourself?
10/31/16, 2:02:59 PM: Chana: Like a thing
10/31/16, 2:06:37 PM: Michael Kolber: Nope
10/31/16, 2:11:18 PM: Chana: That's a lot of money
10/31/16, 2:11:20 PM: Chana: It was all yours?
10/31/16, 2:29:55 PM: Michael Kolber: Yeah. And yeah
10/31/16, 2:30:38 PM: Chana: Wow. That's insane
10/31/16, 2:35:50 PM: Michael Kolber: Yeah...
10/31/16, 2:37:12 PM: Chana: I'm stressed for you
10/31/16, 2:37:47 PM: Chana: I spent 50 bucks last week and I just took the 23 I have left and gave it to mami and Abba to put in my bank account so I don't spend it
10/31/16, 2:37:56 PM: Michael Kolber: Oh
10/31/16, 2:38:00 PM: Michael Kolber: I have a few thousand left
10/31/16, 2:38:10 PM: Michael Kolber: I'm telling you, working is a rewarding thing
10/31/16, 2:38:17 PM: Chana: I'll try
10/31/16, 2:38:36 PM: Chana: And you probably wanna return to America with some cash no?
10/31/16, 2:38:55 PM: Chana: Do you spend a lot a day or
10/31/16, 2:39:25 PM: Chana: My biggest problem is food. Like I spend the majority of my money on food, cuz Teaneck restaurants are so expensive
10/31/16, 2:39:54 PM: Chana: But when I go to Israel I'm gonna do what Abba did and live at pinati for $5 a meal
10/31/16, 2:40:02 PM: Chana: And I'll take leftovers back to the dorm
10/31/16, 3:17:59 PM: Michael Kolber: Pinati isn't $5 a meal. It's not the 80's anymore...
10/31/16, 3:18:14 PM: Michael Kolber: But yeah, I just limit how much I go to restaurants. How often do you eat out??
10/31/16, 4:43:46 PM: Chana: Very eat
10/31/16, 4:43:48 PM: Chana: Much out
10/31/16, 4:44:47 PM: Chana: Well darn. If the price of things is going up, then shouldn't it make sense that my non-existing pay should go up too? This economy is ruining our country.
10/31/16, 4:52:46 PM: Michael Kolber: Uh
10/31/16, 4:52:48 PM: Michael Kolber: Yes?
10/31/16, 4:53:02 PM: Michael Kolber: Sorry I support trump, I don't do this math stuff
10/31/16, 5:22:24 PM: Chana: Do you? Are you gonna vote? Does one have to be in the country to vote?
10/31/16, 5:24:01 PM: Michael Kolber: I ordered an absentee ballot, don't know if it came yet
10/31/16, 5:26:28 PM: Chana: That's cool that those exist. Who are you voting for
10/31/16, 5:26:55 PM: Michael Kolber: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10/31/16, 5:27:07 PM: Chana: If you could stay for a second year in Israel would you
10/31/16, 5:43:33 PM: Michael Kolber: Right now? No
11/1/16, 4:18:02 AM: Michael Kolber: Well, if you go with Abba's plan you could all just move here
11/1/16, 4:34:15 AM: Michael Kolber: Here enjoy this you don't even need wifi
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=z8RkR4rd7dM
11/1/16, 7:15:25 AM: Chana: What was the point of that???
11/1/16, 7:15:43 AM: Chana: And no I don't wanna move there just want you to come back home
11/1/16, 7:15:53 AM: Chana: But you're having a good time I think so that's good

11/19/16, 2:21:49 PM: Michael Kolber: We were at a hotel also. We went on a couple of tours, and as Shabbat ended we sang in this cave by just candlelight, which was awesome. And then we saw a glassblowing thing which was super cool. And now we're headed back
11/19/16, 9:34:40 PM: Chana: That sounds amazing!! That's really cool

11/20/16, 9:52:47 PM: Chana: Asexual what a chill
11/20/16, 9:58:07 PM: Michael Kolber: I'm a man of many talents
11/20/16, 9:59:13 PM: Michael Kolber: But yeah, I'd like to ask her about it. Who even hates on aces? They're like literally doing nothing (nobody?)
11/21/16, 7:16:24 AM: Chana: How does asexual translate into hating on aces? Where does the hating come in?
11/21/16, 7:17:31 AM: Michael Kolber: I don't understand
11/21/16, 8:55:31 AM: Chana: Me neither
11/21/16, 9:05:05 AM: Michael Kolber: What I'm saying is that I don't get people who hate on asexuals. They're just like "Uh... I don't want to have sex with anyone." And people flip out like "wth that's not possible!" and "stop lying to yourself"
11/21/16, 10:27:40 AM: Chana: Ohhhh... haha yeah well it's the same thing with gays. Like just mind your own business
11/21/16, 10:27:54 AM: Chana: But is that a term for asexuals? Aces?
11/21/16, 10:41:22 AM: Michael Kolber: I guess. You're not wrong. But what I'm saying is that even to people who "religiously homophobic" it just doesn't make sense to hate an aces
11/21/16, 10:41:37 AM: Michael Kolber: Yup. Ace community. And aro is aromantic
11/21/16, 10:45:41 AM: Chana: Tf is aromantic
11/21/16, 10:45:45 AM: Chana: Hahaha where did you find that
11/21/16, 10:45:50 AM: Chana: Ew I look gross
11/21/16, 10:45:57 AM: Chana: And from my school Shabbaton
11/21/16, 10:46:30 AM: Michael Kolber: What are you talking about, you look so pretty
11/21/16, 10:46:49 AM: Michael Kolber: Like emotional attraction instead of physical
11/21/16, 12:59:49 PM: Chana: Interesting
11/21/16, 12:59:50 PM: Chana: Thank you
11/21/16, 4:30:22 PM: Michael Kolber: Just reread this and I thought you said "Tf is aromatic" and I thought I had given you an answer on sexuality when you wanted an answer on flowers but it's all good now
11/21/16, 7:49:15 PM: Chana: Hahahahaha what the hayck
11/21/16, 11:49:50 PM: Michael Kolber: ಠ_ಠ
11/22/16, 4:35:40 AM: Michael Kolber: A guy sits down in a diner and asks for a bowl of hot chili. 
The waitress says, "Sorry, but the guy next to you got the last bowl".
He looks over and sees that the guy's finished his meal, but the bowl of chili is still full. He asks, "Are you going to eat that chili?"
The other guy says, "No. Help yourself".
He slides the bowl of chili over and starts to eat. When he gets about half way down, his spoon hits something. He looks down sees a dead mouse and immediately pukes all the chili back into the bowl.
The other guy says, "Yeah, that's about as far as I got, too."
11/22/16, 9:20:19 AM: Chana: Omg
11/22/16, 9:20:26 AM: Chana: That's awful
11/22/16, 9:25:28 AM: Michael Kolber: Mommy thought it was funny
11/22/16, 9:28:54 AM: Chana: Of course she did
11/22/16, 9:29:21 AM: Michael Kolber: She was like "That's really gross but surprisingly funny"
11/22/16, 2:28:42 PM: Chana: Retweet
11/22/16, 2:29:03 PM: Chana: Are you doing anything for thanksgiving?

4/4/17, 7:25:53 AM: Michael Kolber: It just sounds female
4/4/17, 7:31:29 AM: Chana: It's gender non binary
4/4/17, 7:31:55 AM: Michael Kolber: That's still a gender, dudine....
4/4/17, 7:32:24 AM: Chana: No it's gender non binary, NO GENDER
4/4/17, 7:32:30 AM: Michael Kolber: No
4/4/17, 7:32:46 AM: Michael Kolber: Gender non-binary means like a third or fourth or 89th gender
4/4/17, 7:34:20 AM: Chana: WHAY DOES THAT MEAN

4/4/17, 10:26:49 AM: Michael Kolber: Non-binary means not male or female
4/4/17, 10:27:14 AM: Michael Kolber: "Binary" means "one or the other"
Like computers are written in binary because the code is just 0s or 1s

4/19/17, 8:57:45 PM: Chana: I knew it looked too good to be kosher!!!

4/19/17, 8:59:28 PM: Michael Kolber: Was programming and don't have anything to do tomorrow
4/20/17, 6:59:42 AM: Chana: AHH that's crazy
4/20/17, 6:59:55 AM: Chana: And it's kosher but it's ok reddit...?
4/20/17, 7:01:42 AM: Michael Kolber: Oh yeah no that's just a reddit thing

reddit.com/r/EarthPorn

It's just the way the name it. Nothing pornographic on there
4/20/17, 7:16:36 AM: Chana: I know hahaha, I'm familiar with the internet
4/20/17, 7:16:48 AM: Chana: But that steak pic with eggs was on reddit
4/20/17, 7:17:00 AM: Chana: Was that your food or someone else's?
4/20/17, 7:17:18 AM: Michael Kolber: Someone else's
4/20/17, 7:17:24 AM: Michael Kolber: But why does that make it not kosher?
4/20/17, 7:17:57 AM: Chana: Because if you found it online it's most likely not kosher
4/20/17, 7:19:41 AM: Michael Kolber: Except for the butter it's totally kosher
https://www.instagram.com/p/BRcRDG7BB2t/?hl=en
4/20/17, 7:20:16 AM: Chana: No the meat probably wasnt shechted

4/20/17, 7:21:18 AM: Michael Kolber: CUZ ITS A PHOTO
4/20/17, 7:22:27 AM: Chana: like my point was that that pic was such a good pic and looked so nice and they wouldn't serve something so amazing at a kosher restaurant, so therefore I (correctly) assumed that the photo was not taken by you or by a friend, but by some SHIKSA ON THE INTERWEB
4/20/17, 7:22:40 AM: Chana: like yes you could make that kosher
4/20/17, 7:22:43 AM: Michael Kolber: YOURE AN INTERWEEB
4/20/17, 7:22:57 AM: Chana: But the actual picture did no look like one taken at a kosher restaurant
4/20/17, 7:23:01 AM: Chana: That was my point

6/8/17, 1:20:27 PM: Chana: <‎audio omitted>
6/8/17, 1:43:35 PM: Michael Kolber: <‎audio omitted>
6/8/17, 2:00:59 PM: Chana: WOOT
6/8/17, 2:01:01 PM: Chana: NOOOOOO
6/8/17, 2:01:07 PM: Chana: <‎audio omitted>
6/8/17, 3:59:10 PM: Michael Kolber: Sure mate
6/14/17, 6:33:17 PM: Chana: Hey did you have to take a defensive driving class before registering for your road test?
6/14/17, 6:33:32 PM: Michael Kolber: Nope
6/14/17, 6:33:43 PM: Michael Kolber: Oh maybe
6/14/17, 6:33:57 PM: Michael Kolber: It was a five-hour course from Monsey driving school
6/14/17, 6:36:51 PM: Chana: Ugh that sounds annoying
6/14/17, 6:36:56 PM: Chana: How do I register for that
6/14/17, 6:37:32 PM: Michael Kolber: It was only like two and a half to three hours
6/14/17, 6:37:42 PM: Michael Kolber: Call that number and see when they offer it
6/14/17, 6:37:54 PM: Michael Kolber: When you go you just pay $30 or something
6/14/17, 6:38:11 PM: Chana: Thanks so much
6/14/17, 6:38:42 PM: Chana: Wait what's the number
6/14/17, 6:40:08 PM: Michael Kolber: Just google "Monsey driving school" 

and make sure to ask for the address when you call because the one on the website is wrong

Also you didn't do drivers ed in school right? Because that exempts you from this
6/14/17, 6:40:47 PM: Chana: Yeah I didn't
6/14/17, 6:41:34 PM: Chana: Also can I register for the road test before I register for the coarse?
6/14/17, 6:41:43 PM: Michael Kolber: Nope
6/14/17, 6:41:52 PM: Michael Kolber: You need the certificate number in order to register
6/14/17, 6:41:52 PM: Chana: <‎audio omitted>
6/14/17, 6:42:00 PM: Chana: Ugh kk thanks
6/14/17, 6:42:24 PM: Michael Kolber: Also it's spelled course bt-dubs
6/14/17, 6:42:52 PM: Michael Kolber: Coarse is what zebra fur is 🐄

6/26/17, 1:17:42 PM: Chana: Mami wants to know if you'd be able to bring me to the doctor tomorrow at 1:30

7/6/17, 10:24:52 AM: Chana: For future reference, a better way to handle the situation would be to say "can you please stop, I don't like it."
7/6/17, 1:07:53 PM: Michael Kolber: True
7/9/17, 1:53:15 AM: Chana: Hahaha

7/11/17, 6:33:39 PM: Michael Kolber: How's everything been??
7/11/17, 6:33:52 PM: Michael Kolber: Meet new people? Where did you go so far?
7/11/17, 6:33:55 PM: Chana: No yeah not today, it's almost 1 for me. Just whenever they can this week
7/11/17, 6:34:02 PM: Chana: It's been insane
7/11/17, 6:34:16 PM: Chana: I feel like it's been weeks because of all the like time traveling
7/11/17, 6:34:57 PM: Michael Kolber: I totally get that
7/11/17, 6:34:58 PM: Chana: Like in the past five days I've slept 5 hours...and like we've just all gotten so so close cuz it's so crazy
7/11/17, 6:35:05 PM: Chana: We went to Treblinka today
7/11/17, 6:35:10 PM: Michael Kolber: That's amazing :)
7/11/17, 6:35:15 PM: Michael Kolber: I never went
7/11/17, 6:35:52 PM: Chana: And we've gone to like the Warsaw ghetto and train cars cars and like...it's the classic holocaust tour but it's so well done. Everyone bawls but like I haven't been crying which makes me feel like a terrible person
7/11/17, 6:36:03 PM: Chana: Like it hits you really hard
7/11/17, 6:36:42 PM: Chana: Especially since we saw the Warsaw ghetto today and talked about how they were starving to death while we were just fasting for one day...
7/11/17, 6:36:59 PM: Chana: Like it's very dramatic. Horrifying stories are told and it's just crazy
7/11/17, 6:37:04 PM: Chana: But it's very meaningful
7/11/17, 6:37:32 PM: Chana: And we're all like family and we feel like we've known each other forever because we're going through it to gather you know
7/11/17, 6:37:38 PM: Michael Kolber: Don't worry, I barely cried when I went. I only cried once or twice, but it was still really emotionally taxing
7/11/17, 6:37:48 PM: Michael Kolber: I'm sure the fasting really puts it into perspective
7/11/17, 6:37:52 PM: Michael Kolber: At least a bit
7/11/17, 6:38:11 PM: Michael Kolber: Yeah totally get that
7/11/17, 7:55:10 PM: Chana: Yeah but like I haven't cried at all yet and everyone else is
7/11/17, 7:57:33 PM: Michael Kolber: Same here. Don't worry about it :) Just because you feel emotion doesn't mean you have to express it. And just because people express emotions sometimes doesn't always mean they feel it
7/11/17, 7:57:49 PM: Michael Kolber: Different strokes for different folks
7/11/17, 8:50:01 PM: Chana: Thou art very wise
7/11/17, 9:00:56 PM: Michael Kolber: :D
7/11/17, 9:01:04 PM: Michael Kolber: Abba's around if you wanna talk

7/12/17, 2:51:24 AM: Michael Kolber: Not something to apologize for when it's 3am for you haha
7/12/17, 2:51:37 AM: Chana: Haha true and now it's 3 am for you
